# UPI-Fraud-Detection
This project builds a machine learning model to detect UPI transaction fraud. Transactions are labeled as '1' (fraud) or '0' (valid). We began with Logistic Regression using an 80-20 train-test split and compared multiple models, selecting the best based on accuracy, precision, and recall for optimal fraud detection.
